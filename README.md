this isn't in anyway my work I simply made this a install for your convenience 

âš ðŸ”¥ ðŸ‘ŠðŸ’¬: Alright, listen up! I've got a script that lets you bring openwebui to the streets of Android, sans root
access, ya dig? This ain't no watered-down version, it's the full package, baby! We're talkin' remote model clustering,
straight from your fingertips. Imagine takin' advantage of them new-fangled llama3.2 models or Phi Mini, Gemma 2b - and keepin'
'em native on your device, ain't no cloud needed!

Now, here's where it gets even wilder: with this script, you can hook up to your powerful machine at home via remote ollama access! 
It opens up a world of possibilities, my friend. I'm talkin' efficiency, convenience - we're breakin' barriers! The real game-changer
is promotorin' that Debian desktop; just imagine what kind of magic you could whip up with openwebui and those Linux powers combined!

ðŸ‘ŠðŸ’¬: And to all y'all out there, if you want to spread the word about this revolutionary script, come find me on GitHub and get ready
for a ride full of explicit emojis, my friend!

#you dont need root

#you do need proot debian desktop

#its straight fwd

If u want to test this I completed a simple script for dummy's no disrespect. It's simple.. Install f droid mareket off google .
install termux from there .

Then only requirement is you u install a proot Linux desktop 

For this script the desktop I used was this dudes 

https://github.com/sabamdarif/termux-desktop

There's a single curl command u copy and paste into the termux terminal. And press enter 

Pick debian and xfce when asked 

Yes to all /options 3 to all
No wall paper

After that's done 

Run my script


After it completes u just activate venv again
source myenv/bin/activate

Then open-webui serve
